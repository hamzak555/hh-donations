PROJECT DEVELOPMENT RULES
========================

1. BROWSER REFRESH RULE
   - Always reload the browser tab after making changes to show updates
   - Ensure the development server is running before reloading
   - Verify changes are visible in the browser

2. GITHUB BACKUP RULE
   - Periodically backup the project to GitHub repository
   - Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages
   - Push to remote repository regularly

3. FILE MANAGEMENT RULES
   - NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
   - ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
   - NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

4. CODE STYLE RULES
   - Follow existing code conventions in the project
   - Match the existing indentation and formatting style
   - Use existing libraries and utilities - don't assume new ones are available

5. TESTING & VERIFICATION
   - Test all changes before considering them complete
   - Run lint and typecheck commands when available
   - Verify functionality works as expected

6. COMMUNICATION
   - Keep responses concise and direct
   - Show results rather than explaining what will be done
   - Focus on completing the requested task without unnecessary elaboration

7. SERVER TROUBLESHOOTING - ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED FIX
   When encountering "localhost refused to connect" or ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED:
   
   STEP 1: Kill all conflicting processes
   - Run: killall node
   - Or specifically: pkill -f "react-scripts" and pkill -f "npm start"
   
   STEP 2: Check for port conflicts
   - Check port 3000: lsof -i :3000
   - Check port 3001: lsof -i :3001
   - Kill any process using these ports: kill -9 [PID]
   
   STEP 3: Start server with explicit port in background
   - Navigate to app directory: cd /Users/hamzakhalid/Desktop/HH_Donations/hh-donations-app
   - Start with nohup: PORT=3000 nohup npm start > app.log 2>&1 &
   
   STEP 4: Verify server is running
   - Wait 8 seconds for server to compile
   - Test connection: curl -I http://localhost:3000
   - Check process: ps aux | grep 'react-scripts' | grep -v grep
   
   STEP 5: Open browser
   - Run: open http://localhost:3000
   - If still not working, manually refresh browser or clear cache
   
   ROOT CAUSE: The server was trying to use port 3001 instead of 3000, and old processes were hanging without properly binding to ports.
   
   PREVENTION: Always use PORT=3000 when starting the server and ensure no zombie processes are running.
